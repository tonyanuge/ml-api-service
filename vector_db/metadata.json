    "text": "Context Cortex 2.0: The Realistic, Executable Plan The Pivot: From Infrastructure to Implementation Original Problem: Context Cortex 1.0 tried to be infrastructure (API layer). Infrastructure sales are slow, technical, and require enterprise credibility you don't have yet. New Approach: Be the done-for-you AI implementation service that uses context intelligence as your secret weapon. Business Name: Cortex Implementations One-Sentence Pitch: \"We implement AI agents that actually know your business\u2014guaranteed working in 2 weeks or your money back\u2014because we've solved the context problem everyone else ignores.\" Why This Version Works Better 1. Faster Sales Cycle Old: \"Buy our API and integrate it yourself\" (3-6 month sales cycle) New: \"We'll build you a working AI customer support agent in 2 weeks for \u20ac3k\" (1-2 week sales cycle) 2. Immediate Cash Flow Old: Monthly subscriptions that take months to build up New: \u20ac3k-\u20ac5k upfront implementation fees + \u20ac500/month maintenance 3. Prove Value First Old: They pay before seeing results New: They see a working solution in week 1, pay when satisfied 4. Lower Technical Barrier Old: Clients need technical teams to integrate your API New: You do everything, they just use itThe Specific Offer (Ultra-Focused) Target: B2B SaaS Companies with Zendesk (or similar) + 100+ support tickets/month What You Build For Them: \"The Context-Aware Support Agent\" A custom AI agent that: 1. Has read and understood their entire knowledge base, previous tickets, and product documentation 2. Can answer 60-70% of tier-1 support questions instantly 3. Routes complex issues to humans with full context 4. Gets smarter every week by learning from human responses Pricing Structure: Implementation: \u20ac3,500 (one-time, paid 50% upfront, 50% on delivery) Monthly Maintenance: \u20ac650/month (covers API costs, monitoring, weekly improvements) Money-Back Guarantee: If it doesn't handle 50+ tickets in the first month, full refund The \u20ac0-\u20ac10k Roadmap (Realistic Timeline) Month 1:"

Niche Discipline Stick to B2B SaaS with Zendesk until you have 10 clients. Don't chase every opportunity. 2. Money-Back Guarantee This eliminates the biggest objection. You can afford it because you'll nail the delivery. 3. Weekly Improvement Calls Schedule 15-min calls with each client weekly for first month. This ensures retention and generates testimonials.4.

This study aims to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning models in classifying similar physical activities and estimating energy expenditure, by leveraging big data and neural network modeling, particularly focusing on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Introduction: Why? Existing PAM systems show limitations in distinguishing activities with similar movement patterns and accurately estimating energy expenditure. This research aims to address these challenges by applying an integrated approach that combines data from multiple sources and utilizes the capabilities of advanced neural networks. Research and Technical Objectives: Develop a deep learning model that integrates multi-sensor wearable data and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of physical activity classification. Compare the performance of the proposed model against traditional machine learning models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Assess the impact of including environmental data on the prediction accuracy of different physical activities and energy expenditures. Evaluate the real-time processing capabilities of the proposed model for potential deployment in wearable devices. Investigate the model's adaptability and personalization potential across different user demographics. Correct Sampling Strategy: The study will recruit a diverse population exceeding the initial 9 subjects to ensure variety in age, health status, and physical activity patterns. A stratified sampling method will be used to ensure representativeness across different groups, enhancing the model's generalization capability.

Adding Value to the Area of Research Already Done: This study intends to extend the existing body of PAM research by introducing an advanced model that can handle complex data patterns and provide more precise activity recognition and energy expenditure estimates. By incorporating environmental factors, the research adds a new dimension to activity monitoring, providing insights into how external conditions affect physical activities. Understanding & Managing Bias: To mitigate bias, the study will use diverse datasets and validate the model across different populations. Techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and ensemble methods will be employed to reduce overfitting and ensure the model's robustness and fairness. Researching Vulnerable Groups: The study will include vulnerable groups such as the elderly or individuals with chronic conditions to ensure the model's effectiveness and adaptability across different health statuses.

Cundall, Mining Surveys Ltd., Holroyd Road, Reading, Berks. Dear Pete, Permit me to introduce you to the facility of facsimile transmission. In facsimile a photocell is caused to perform a raster scan over the subject copy. The variations of print density on the document cause the photocell to generate an analogous electrical video signal. This signal is used to modulate a carrier, which is transmitted to a remote destination over a radio or cable communications link. At the remote terminal, demodulation reconstructs the video signal, which is used to modulate the density of print produced by a printing device. This device is scanning in a raster scan synchronised with that at the transmitting terminal. As a result, a facsimile copy of the subject document is produced. Probably you have uses for this facility in your organisation. Yours sincerely, ThA. P.J. CROSS Group Leader - Facsimile Research Registered in England: No. 2088 No. 1 Registered Office: 6O Vicara Lane, Ilford. Eseex,"
